# byo-redis-lab
## Build your own redis lab implementation in Rust

Challenge from [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

Implemented in Rust. Used tests provided by codecrafters to validate.

Original problem did not require locks on hashmap, but that's a good
practice to have that shared storage for this lab.
